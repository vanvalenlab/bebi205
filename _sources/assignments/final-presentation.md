# Final Presentation

```{admonition} Due Date
Seniors and Grad Students: 6/9 (End of finals)

Undergraduates: 6/16 (End of finals)
```

Each group will give a 5-10 minute presentation on their project. The purpose of these presentations is to share your work with the rest of class. Focus on briefly and clearly addressing the following points:

- What problem are you solving with deep learning?
- Why is deep learning an appropriate solution to this problem?
- What dataset did you use and how did you prepare it?
- What is your takeaway from this project? This could be the findings from your model, an unexpected challenge that you discovered or any other insight.
