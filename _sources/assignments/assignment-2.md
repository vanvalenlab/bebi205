For this assignment, please submit a jupyter notebook (as an html or pdf file) that demonstrates the following:

- Description and source of the dataset
- Describe what question or task you are planning to address with this dataset
- Loading the dataset into the notebook
- Perform any necessary preprocessing that would be necessary in order to train a model from the dataset
- Provide plots and/or statistics to summarize your dataset

Reasonable attempts at progress will be awarded full credit.
