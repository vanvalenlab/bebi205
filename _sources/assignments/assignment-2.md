# Assignment 2: Preliminary Proposal and Dataset Exploration

```{admonition} Due Date
Friday 4/28 at 5pm
```

Please select a preliminary dataset that you are considering using for your final project. In a few sentences, describe what question or task you are planning to address with this dataset. You may change your mind in the future as your project develops.

For this assignment, please submit a jupyter notebook (as an html or pdf file) that demonstrates the following:

- Description and source of the dataset
- Describe what question or task you are planning to address with this dataset
- Demonstrate your ability to load the dataset. You don't need to load the entire thing -- if the dataset isn't already in a nice format, just show that you can scrape it and save it in a readable format. 
- Perform any necessary preprocessing that would be necessary in order to train a model from the dataset

Reasonable attempts at progress will be awarded full credit.
