# Syllabus

## Objective
This course is meant to be a practical introduction to deep learning methods for biological data. Our goal is to provide you with the tools necessary to apply these methods to your own data. We also want to give you enough conceptual knowledge to know what to do when things do not work.

The course will be have two primary components.
1. Lectures will be high level and conceptual. They will be recorded, but live attendance is encouraged.
2. Jupyter Notebooks will serve as practical guides to the concepts introduced in lecture.

## Academic Integrity
Caltech’s Honor Code: “No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.”

Understanding and Avoiding Plagiarism: Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit, and it violates the honor code in a fundamental way.

## Students with Documented Disabilities
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS).  Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact CASS as soon as possible, since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. http://cass.caltech.edu/ (Links to an external site.)

Undergraduate students should contact Dr. Lesley Nye, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Students (administrative contact: Beth Larranaga) and graduate students should contact Dr. Kate McAnulty, Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (administrative contact: Jacob Dalton).
