# Final Project
```{eval-rst}
Last updated |lastupdate|
```

Your final project will consist of half of your grade and serves as an opportunity for hands on exploration of using deep learning on a question of your choice. You may work on your own or in a group.

## Project Proposal - Due 4/26
A preliminary proposal is due in week 5. Please submit your proposal through Canvas. The proposal should be less than a page long and address the following questions:

1. What problem are you investigating? Why is it interesting?
2. What dataset are you going to use? How are you planning on acquiring the dataset and performing any necessary annotation?
3. How is deep learning going to help you with your science? Is it automating a laborous task, performing inference or some other application? What method or algorithm are you implementing? Your answer does not need to be precise, but it should give us an idea of where you are heading.
4. How are you going to evaluate your results? Consider both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

The instructors will provide brief feedback by the end of the week on each proposal.

## Final Presentation
Each group will give a 5-10 minute presentation during week 10 (5/31, 6/2). Focus on highlighting how you are using deep learning to solve a problem.
## Final Report
The written report should be around 4 pages and will be due at the end of finals period. You should address the following topics:

* Introduction - Describe the problem you are working on and why it is important.
* Data - Describe the data you are working with. What type of data is it and how was it generated? Did you perform any preprocessing on the data?
* Method - Describe your approach to addressing the problem described in the introduction. Did you consider any alternative approaches? Why was your approach the right choice?
* Results - Describe your results including any qualitative or quantitative analysis you performed to evaluate your results.
* Conclusion - Summarize your key results and any conclusions. What future work could be done in this line of investigation?
