# Final Presentation

```{admonition} Due Date
Seniors: 6/2
All Others: Week 10 (6/6, 6/8)
```

Each group will give a 5-10 minute presentation during week 10 (6/6, 6/8). The purpose of these presentations is to share your work with the rest of class. Focus on briefly and clearly addressing the following points:

- What problem are you solving with deep learning?
- Why is deep learning an appropriate solution to this problem?
- What dataset did you use and how did you prepare it?
- What is your takeaway from this project? This could be the findings from your model, an unexpected challenge that you discovered or any other insight.

A sign up sheet will be posted on Canvas a few weeks before week 10. Groups with seniors may submit a video recording of their presentation prior to the end of senior classes on 6/2.
