```{admonition} Due Date
Friday 5/5 at 5pm
```

A project proposal is due in week 5. Please submit your proposal through Canvas. The proposal should be less than a page long and address the following questions:

1. What problem are you investigating? Why is it interesting?
1. What dataset are you going to use? How are you planning on acquiring the dataset and performing any necessary annotation?
1. How is deep learning going to help you with your science? Is it automating a laborious task, performing inference or some other application? What method or algorithm are you implementing? Your answer does not need to be precise, but it should give us an idea of where you are heading.
1. Is deep learning an appropriate approach to solving this problem? Why?
1. How are you going to evaluate your results? Consider both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
