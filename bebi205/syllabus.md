## Objective
This course is meant to be a practical introduction to deep learning methods for biological data. Our goal is to provide you with the tools necessary to apply these methods to your own data. We also want to give you enough conceptual knowledge to know what to do when things do not work.

The course will be have two primary components.
1. Lectures will be high level and conceptual. They will be recorded, but live attendance is encouraged.
2. Jupyter Notebooks will serve as practical guides to the concepts introduced in lecture.

### Journal Club
Students will assemble into groups of up to 4 individuals to present a single paper for journal club. Live attendance is required in order to give the presentation. Make-ups will not be available. A sign up sheet is posted on Canvas. Please sign up by the end of the day on April 5.

Journal club presentations should be between 15-20 minutes. You should prepare ~10 slides in order to walk us through the relevant figures and address the following points:

- What problem is the paper trying to solve?
- How do they solve the problem?

### Late Assignments
Late assignments will lose 10% for each day late. Extensions for due dates can be granted by the TA in light of extenuating circumstances. Please reach out prior to the deadline.

## Compute Resources
Weekly course notebooks can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#) for free. Each notebook in this book has one or two buttons that will launch the notebook and its key in Colab.

Cluster access will be provided for your final projects and more information will be added in the next few weeks.
